/** Branch and Exchange (BX)

This instruction is only executed if the condition is true. 

This instruction performs a branch by copying the contents of a general register, Rn,
into the program counter, PC. The branch causes a pipeline flush and refill from the
address specified by Rn. This instruction also permits the instruction set to be
exchanged. When the instruction is executed, the value of Rn[0] determines whether
the instruction stream will be decoded as ARM or THUMB instructions.

Syntax:

BX - branch and exchange.

BX{cond} Rn

{cond} Two character condition mnemonic.

Rn is an expression evaluating to a valid register number.

Using R15 as an operand
If R15 is used as an operand, the behaviour is undefined.
