/** Branch and Branch with Link (B, BL)
 *
 * The instruction is only executed if the condition is true.
 *
 * Branch instructions contain a signed 2's complement 24 bit offset. This is shifted left
 * two bits, sign extended to 32 bits, and added to the PC. The instruction can therefore
 * specify a branch of +/- 32Mbytes. The branch offset must take account of the prefetch
 * operation, which causes the PC to be 2 words (8 bytes) ahead of the current
 * instruction.
 *
 * Branches beyond +/- 32Mbytes must use an offset or absolute destination which has
 * been previously loaded into a register. In this case the PC should be manually saved
 * in R14 if a Branch with Link type operation is required.
 *
 * The link bit
 *
 * Branch with Link (BL) writes the old PC into the link register (R14) of the current bank.
 * The PC value written into R14 is adjusted to allow for the prefetch, and contains the
 * address of the instruction following the branch and link instruction. Note that the CPSR
 * is not saved with the PC and R14[1:0] are always cleared.
 * To return from a routine called by Branch with Link use MOV PC,R14 if the link register
 * is still valid or LDM Rn!,{..PC} if the link register has been saved onto a stack pointed
 * to by Rn.
 *
 * Syntax:
 *
 * Items in {} are optional. Items in <> must be present.
 *
 * B{L}{cond} <expression>
 *
 * {L} is used to request the Branch with Link form of the instruction.
 * If absent, R14 will not be affected by the instruction.
 *
 * {cond} is a two-character mnemonic
 * If absent then AL (ALways) will be used.
 *
 * <expression> is the destination. The assembler calculates the offset.
